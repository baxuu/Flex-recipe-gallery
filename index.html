                    Place a
                    baking sheet in the oven
                    while it is heating. Unroll one of the pie doughs and transfer to a 9-inch standard pie pan. Press
                    the
                    dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate, being careful not to puncture the dough.
                    Unroll
                    the second pie dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Use a paring knife to make 5 to 6 large
                    vent
                    holes in this top crust. Transfer to a baking sheet. Refrigerate the pie shell and top crust while
                    making the filling.</p>

                    accumulated liquid. Transfer the apples to the now-empty bowl. Add the cornstarch, lemon juice,

                    small bowl

                    about making things perfectly level, but avoid large gaps and you’re less likely to get a shrunken
                    filling and domed crust. The apples will be slightly taller than the pie pan. Discard any liquid
                    left in the bottom of the bowl.</p>
